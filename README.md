**Smart Pet Feeding System**


The ”Automated Pet Feeding System” is a cutting-edge
project aimed at revolutionizing the way pets are cared for by
introducing a smart and efficient feeding solution. This project
leverages microprocessor technology to create a hands-free,
customizable, and reliable feeding system for pets, offering
numerous benefits to both pet owners and their furry companions.
The primary objective of this project is to design and
develop an automated pet feeding system that simplifies the
daily feeding routine for pet owners while ensuring the health
and well-being of their pets. By utilizing a microprocessor controlled mechanism, this system will accurately dispense
appropriate portions of pet food at scheduled intervals, all
while addressing safety concerns and promoting convenience.
